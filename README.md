# End-to-End-Machine-Learning-Pipeline #

## Complete Pipeline for House Prices Prediction ##

_In this project we built an entire end to end machine learning pipeline for accurate house prices prediction. We divide the project into 4 steps. Each step has a separate purpose._

1. A numbered list
              1. A nested numbered list
              2. Which is numbered
          2. Which is numbered

* Step 1: In the first stage we do a prelimnary data analysis to identify:
  * sksks
1. Missing values
1. Numerical variables
1. Distribution of the numerical variables
1. Outliers
1. Categorical variables
1. Cardinality of the categorical variables
1. Potential relationship between the variables and the target: SalePrice
