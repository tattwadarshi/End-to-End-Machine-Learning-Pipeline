# End-to-End-Machine-Learning-Pipeline #

## Complete Pipeline for House Prices Prediction ##

_In this project we built an entire end to end machine learning pipeline for accurate house prices prediction. We divide the project into 4 steps. Each step has a separate purpose._

1. A numbered list
              1. A nested numbered list
              2. Which is numbered
          2. Which is numbered

* Step 1: In the first stage we do a prelimnary data analysis to identify:
Missing values
Numerical variables
Distribution of the numerical variables
Outliers
Categorical variables
Cardinality of the categorical variables
Potential relationship between the variables and the target: SalePrice
