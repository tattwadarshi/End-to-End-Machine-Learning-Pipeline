# End-to-End-Machine-Learning-Pipeline #

## Complete Pipeline for House Prices Prediction ##

* In this project we built an entire end to end machine learning pipeline for accurate house prices prediction. We divide the project into 4 steps. Each step has a separate purpose. *

* Step 1: In the first stage we do a prelimnary data analysis to identify:
Missing values
Numerical variables
Distribution of the numerical variables
Outliers
Categorical variables
Cardinality of the categorical variables
Potential relationship between the variables and the target: SalePrice
